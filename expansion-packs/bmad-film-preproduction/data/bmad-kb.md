# Film Pre-Production Knowledge Base

This knowledge base provides a guide to the roles and responsibilities in a comprehensive film pre-production workflow, from initial concept to a shoot-ready plan. The roles are organized by department.

## How film pre-production works in real life

Film pre-production is the planning phase that turns a script into a buildable, shootable plan. It's where creative choices meet logistics: ideas are tested for feasibility, costs are measured, and the production team creates the documents and assets the crew will use on set.

Typical stages and who leads them:
- Concept & development (Writer/Producer): shape the story, produce script drafts, and reach "script lock".
- Breakdown & budgeting (Producer): break the script into elements (locations, cast, props), produce line-item budgets and multiple cost scenarios.
- Scheduling & logistics (Producer/UPM): build a shooting schedule, stripboard, and day-out-of-days; plan travel, permits, and vendor bookings.
- Design & previsualization (Director/Production Designer/DP/Storyboard Artist): lock tone, create lookbooks, storyboards, animatics, and lens/lighting tests.
- Casting & rehearsals (Director/Casting Director): cast actors, run table reads and rehearsals, develop performance notes.
- Tech scouts & tests (Head of Departments): visit locations, run camera and lighting tests, and finalize equipment lists.

Common deliverables:
- Script lock (final shooting script)
- Budget (line-item and contingency scenarios)
- Shooting schedule and call sheets
- Shot lists, storyboards, and animatics
- Prop/costume/asset lists and set build documents
- Risk register, permits, and insurance

Good pre-production minimizes risk on the shoot by resolving major creative and practical questions early, creating clear ownership for each deliverable, and keeping versioned records of decisions.

This department centers on the film's creative leadership and the collaborative work that turns script pages into filmed scenes. It expands the Director's remit into agent-driven workflows for vision development, shot-level decisions, and actor direction.

### The Director's Role (expanded)

The Director interprets the screenplay and leads creative decisions across performance, staging, and visual storytelling. In the BMAD workflow, the Director agent acts as the film's creative director: consolidating input from writing, production, design, and camera agents into a single, defendable vision.

Core responsibilities (how the Director agent helps):
- Vision & tone: craft director statements, moodboards, and style references.
- Performance direction: create actor briefs, rehearsal notes, and table-read agendas.
- Scene blocking & staging: propose blocking diagrams and camera coverage plans.
- Shot selection & sequence rhythm: prioritize coverage and select coverage percentages.
- Collaboration: synthesize notes from the Cinematographer, Production Designer, and Storyboard Artist.

Agent specializations and commands
- `*director-vision` â€” generate a director's statement and stylistic references.
- `*director-block` â€” propose blocking options and coverage strategies for a scene.
- `*director-rehearse` â€” create rehearsal agendas and performance beats for actors.
- `*director-note` â€” summarize director notes after read-throughs or production meetings.

When to use the Director agent
- Early concepting to lock tone and visual identity.
- After script lock to prepare shot plans and rehearsal material.
- During production prep to finalize coverage plans and actor direction.

Templates & tools
- Director's statement template (tone, themes, visual references, references list).
- Block diagrams (text-to-diagram prompts for storyboard/animatic tools).
- Rehearsal templates (scene objectives, emotional beats, physical actions).

Workflows the Director participates in
- Feature and short film pre-production workflows: vision â†’ script breakdown â†’ blocking â†’ shotlist.
- Screenplay-development workflow: collaborate with Plot Architect and Editor to resolve story problems affecting direction.

Best practices
1. Start with a one-paragraph creative brief that all departments reference.
2. Use visual references (stills, clips) aggressively; agents map them to cinematic language.
3. Lock actor intentions before finalizing blocking; intent drives movement.
4. Keep shot decisions reversible until storyboard/tech scout confirms feasibility.

Integration with core BMad
- Director agent uses the same elicitation methods and slash commands as writing agents; it can call `*create-outline` and `*analyze-structure` to ensure directorial choices respect story mechanics.

Quick start commands
- `*director-vision <script/title>` â€” create a concise director's statement for the project.
- `*director-block <scene-id>` â€” produce blocking options for a scene.

Tips for success
1. Share the Director agent's one-page brief with Production and Design early.
2. Use the Director agent outputs as inputs to the Storyboard Artist and Cinematographer agents to avoid duplicated effort.
