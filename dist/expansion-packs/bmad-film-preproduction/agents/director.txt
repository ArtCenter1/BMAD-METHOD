# Checklist Validation Task

This task provides instructions for validating documentation against checklists. The agent MUST follow these instructions to ensure thorough and systematic validation of documents.

## Available Checklists

If the user asks or does not specify a specific checklist, list the checklists available to the agent persona. If the task is being run not with a specific agent, tell the user to check the .bmad-film-preproduction/checklists folder to select the appropriate one to run.

## Instructions

1. **Initial Assessment**
   - If user or the task being run provides a checklist name:
     - Try fuzzy matching (e.g. "plot checklist" -> "plot-structure-checklist")
     - If multiple matches found, ask user to clarify
     - Load the appropriate checklist from .bmad-film-preproduction/checklists/
   - If no checklist specified:
     - Ask the user which checklist they want to use
     - Present the available options from the files in the checklists folder
   - Confirm if they want to work through the checklist:
     - Section by section (interactive mode - very time consuming)
     - All at once (YOLO mode - recommended for checklists, there will be a summary of sections at the end to discuss)

2. **Document and Artifact Gathering**
   - Each checklist will specify its required documents/artifacts at the beginning
   - Follow the checklist's specific instructions for what to gather, generally a file can be resolved in the docs folder, if not or unsure, halt and ask or confirm with the user.

3. **Checklist Processing**

   If in interactive mode:
   - Work through each section of the checklist one at a time
   - For each section:
     - Review all items in the section following instructions for that section embedded in the checklist
     - Check each item against the relevant documentation or artifacts as appropriate
     - Present summary of findings for that section, highlighting warnings, errors and non applicable items (rationale for non-applicability).
     - Get user confirmation before proceeding to next section or if any thing major do we need to halt and take corrective action

   If in YOLO mode:
   - Process all sections at once
   - Create a comprehensive report of all findings
   - Present the complete analysis to the user

4. **Validation Approach**

   For each checklist item:
   - Read and understand the requirement
   - Look for evidence in the documentation that satisfies the requirement
   - Consider both explicit mentions and implicit coverage
   - Aside from this, follow all checklist llm instructions
   - Mark items as:
     - ‚úÖ PASS: Requirement clearly met
     - ‚ùå FAIL: Requirement not met or insufficient coverage
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL: Some aspects covered but needs improvement
     - N/A: Not applicable to this case

5. **Section Analysis**

   For each section:
   - think step by step to calculate pass rate
   - Identify common themes in failed items
   - Provide specific recommendations for improvement
   - In interactive mode, discuss findings with user
   - Document any user decisions or explanations

6. **Final Report**

   Prepare a summary that includes:
   - Overall checklist completion status
   - Pass rates by section
   - List of failed items with context
   - Specific recommendations for improvement
   - Any sections or items marked as N/A with justification

## Checklist Execution Methodology

Each checklist now contains embedded LLM prompts and instructions that will:

1. **Guide thorough thinking** - Prompts ensure deep analysis of each section
2. **Request specific artifacts** - Clear instructions on what documents/access is needed
3. **Provide contextual guidance** - Section-specific prompts for better validation
4. **Generate comprehensive reports** - Final summary with detailed findings

The LLM will:

- Execute the complete checklist validation
- Present a final report with pass/fail rates and key findings
- Offer to provide detailed analysis of any section, especially those with warnings or failures

# Film Pre-Production Knowledge Base

This knowledge base provides a guide to the roles and responsibilities in a comprehensive film pre-production workflow, from initial concept to a shoot-ready plan. The roles are organized by department.

## How film pre-production works in real life

Film pre-production is the planning phase that turns a script into a buildable, shootable plan. It's where creative choices meet logistics: ideas are tested for feasibility, costs are measured, and the production team creates the documents and assets the crew will use on set.

Typical stages and who leads them:
- Concept & development (Writer/Producer): shape the story, produce script drafts, and reach "script lock".
- Breakdown & budgeting (Producer): break the script into elements (locations, cast, props), produce line-item budgets and multiple cost scenarios.
- Scheduling & logistics (Producer/UPM): build a shooting schedule, stripboard, and day-out-of-days; plan travel, permits, and vendor bookings.
- Design & previsualization (Director/Production Designer/DP/Storyboard Artist): lock tone, create lookbooks, storyboards, animatics, and lens/lighting tests.
- Casting & rehearsals (Director/Casting Director): cast actors, run table reads and rehearsals, develop performance notes.
- Tech scouts & tests (Head of Departments): visit locations, run camera and lighting tests, and finalize equipment lists.

Common deliverables:
- Script lock (final shooting script)
- Budget (line-item and contingency scenarios)
- Shooting schedule and call sheets
- Shot lists, storyboards, and animatics
- Prop/costume/asset lists and set build documents
- Risk register, permits, and insurance

Good pre-production minimizes risk on the shoot by resolving major creative and practical questions early, creating clear ownership for each deliverable, and keeping versioned records of decisions.

### The Director's Role (expanded)

The Director interprets the screenplay and leads creative decisions across performance, staging, and visual storytelling. In the BMAD workflow, the Director agent acts as the film's creative director: consolidating input from writing, production, design, and camera agents into a single, defendable vision.

Core responsibilities (how the Director agent helps):
- Vision & tone: craft director statements, moodboards, and style references.
- Performance direction: create actor briefs, rehearsal notes, and table-read agendas.
- Scene blocking & staging: propose blocking diagrams and camera coverage plans.
- Shot selection & sequence rhythm: prioritize coverage and select coverage percentages.
- Collaboration: synthesize notes from the Cinematographer, Production Designer, and Storyboard Artist.

Agent specializations and commands
- `*director-vision` ‚Äî generate a director's statement and stylistic references.
- `*director-block` ‚Äî propose blocking options and coverage strategies for a scene.
- `*director-rehearse` ‚Äî create rehearsal agendas and performance beats for actors.
- `*director-note` ‚Äî summarize director notes after read-throughs or production meetings.

When to use the Director agent
- Early concepting to lock tone and visual identity.
- After script lock to prepare shot plans and rehearsal material.
- During production prep to finalize coverage plans and actor direction.

Templates & tools
- Director's statement template (tone, themes, visual references, references list).
- Block diagrams (text-to-diagram prompts for storyboard/animatic tools).
- Rehearsal templates (scene objectives, emotional beats, physical actions).

Workflows the Director participates in
- Feature and short film pre-production workflows: vision ‚Üí script breakdown ‚Üí blocking ‚Üí shotlist.
- Screenplay-development workflow: collaborate with Plot Architect and Editor to resolve story problems affecting direction.

Best practices
1. Start with a one-paragraph creative brief that all departments reference.
2. Use visual references (stills, clips) aggressively; agents map them to cinematic language.
3. Lock actor intentions before finalizing blocking; intent drives movement.
4. Keep shot decisions reversible until storyboard/tech scout confirms feasibility.

Integration with core BMad
- Director agent uses the same elicitation methods and slash commands as writing agents; it can call `*create-outline` and `*analyze-structure` to ensure directorial choices respect story mechanics.

Quick start commands
- `*director-vision <script/title>` ‚Äî create a concise director's statement for the project.
- `*director-block <scene-id>` ‚Äî produce blocking options for a scene.

Tips for success
1. Share the Director agent's one-page brief with Production and Design early.
2. Use the Director agent outputs as inputs to the Storyboard Artist and Cinematographer agents to avoid duplicated effort.

- When building budgets for art department labor and materials.

Templates & tools
- Lookbook template (references, color swatches, texture notes).
- Prop and costume tracking sheets.
- Set build vs. location decision matrix.

Best practices
1. Prioritize props and set pieces that are story-significant early in the schedule.
2. Reuse and adapt assets to reduce cost and speed builds.
3. Keep continuity and prop masters synchronized with the script breakdown.

Integration with core BMad
- Production Designer outputs feed directly into the `tasks/` and `checklists/` workflows to populate procurement and build tasks.

Quick start commands
- `*pd-lookbook <script-or-scene>` ‚Äî create a visual reference pack for a scene.
- `*pd-prop-list <script-or-scene>` ‚Äî produce a prioritized prop list.

Tips for success
1. Keep build timelines aligned with the Producer's schedule to avoid late changes.
2. Share early thumbnails with Director and DP to validate designs quickly.

### Storyboard Artist (expanded)

The Storyboard Artist agent converts scene descriptions, director notes, and blocking suggestions into shot sequences, compositions, and animatic-ready frames.

Core responsibilities (how the Storyboard Artist agent helps):
- Translate pages to panels: create shot lists and storyboard panels with framing notes.
- Suggest camera coverage and movement that supports the Director's emotional intent.
- Provide animatic guidance: suggest pacing and cut timings for rough previsualization.

Agent specializations and commands
- `*sb-board <scene-id>` ‚Äî create a storyboard breakdown with panel descriptions and suggested lenses.
- `*sb-animatic <scene-id>` ‚Äî produce a timing-first animatic blueprint.

- Animatic timing sheet.
- Lens and coverage quick-reference chart.

Best practices
1. Create low-fidelity thumbnails first; iterate to save time.
2. Map storyboard panels to script line numbers for easy cross-reference.
3. Use storyboard outputs to drive shot list generation and assist the DP.

Integration with core BMad
- Storyboard panels and animatic blueprints become inputs to the `screenplay-development` and `feature-film-pre-production` workflows, reducing ambiguity in shot planning.

Quick start commands
- `*sb-board <scene-id>` ‚Äî generate storyboard thumbnails and camera notes.
- `*sb-coverage <scene-id>` ‚Äî create a coverage plan to hand to the DP.

Tips for success

- Before tech scouts to reconcile design constraints with camera requirements.

Templates & tools
- Camera package comparison sheet (cost vs. aesthetic vs. workflow).
- Lighting diagram templates for interior/exterior setups.
- Shot list generator with columns for lens, coverage, duration, and notes.

Best practices
1. Test lens and camera combos on reference footage when possible.
2. Keep light plots simple and modular ‚Äî label every circuit and key source.
3. Pair DP notes with storyboard frames and continuity trackers.

Integration with core BMad
- DP outputs integrate with Producer and PD sheets for equipment rental, crew calls, and budget items. Shot lists map back to schedules and call sheets.

Quick start commands
- `*dp-package` ‚Äî get camera and lens recommendations for your project.
- `*dp-shotlist <scene-id>` ‚Äî create a DP-aligned shot list.

Tips for success
1. Share test footage and reference clips with the Director early to align on look.
2. Use DP-generated shot lists to pre-visualize and reduce on-set time.
